# Task: Building Digital Circuits using Verilog Language

The target of this task is to start building digital circuits using Verilog language. The circuits should contain both combinational logic and sequential logic, implemented using the `always` block.


### Using the `always` Block

In Verilog, the `always` block is used to specify the behaviour of a circuit in response to changes in inputs or based on clock edges for sequential logic. Inside the `always` block, you can use procedural constructs like `if`, `else`, `case`, and more to describe the circuit's functionality.

Block(Module) Name: DigCt  
Inputs: IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4, IN5, CLK (all inputs of 1-bit width)  
Outputs: OUT1, OUT2, OUT3 (output of 1-bit width)
